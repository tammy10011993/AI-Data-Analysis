# ðŸ§  K-Means Customer Segmentation â€“ Wholesale Dataset

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment wholesale customers based on their annual spending behavior across multiple product categories. The objective is to uncover patterns that can drive data-informed business decisions, such as personalized promotions, product bundling, and region-based logistics planning.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes:

- Annual spending in units (Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, Delicassen)
- Categorical features: `Channel` (1 = Horeca, 2 = Retail) and `Region` (1 = Lisbon, 2 = Oporto, 3 = Other)

---

## ðŸ§ª Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
2. **Feature Scaling using StandardScaler**
3. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Elbow Method to determine optimal K
   - Silhouette Score to evaluate cluster quality
4. **Dimensionality Reduction using PCA**
5. **Cluster Visualization**
6. **Cluster Profiling**
   - Average spending per category per cluster
   - Channel and region composition
7. **Business Insights & Strategy**
   - Targeted promotions
   - Product bundling suggestions
   - Region-wise logistics planning

---

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- Elbow Method plot
- Silhouette Score (optional)
- Cluster scatterplot (PCA)
- Heatmap of cluster profiles
- Cluster Ã— Channel and Cluster Ã— Region stacked bar plots

---

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- Some clusters are high in Fresh & Milk (likely Horeca)
- Others are Retail-dominant with high Grocery and Frozen
- Region overlays showed majority of customers in "Other" areas
- Segment-specific strategies help optimize promotions and inventory

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (for visualization)
- scikit-learn (StandardScaler, KMeans, PCA)
- Tableau (for dashboard visualization â€“ optional)
- VS Code (with GitHub Copilot & Data Wrangler)
