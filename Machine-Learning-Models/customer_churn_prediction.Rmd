# ðŸ“Š Introduction
Customer churn is a **critical issue** in the telecom industry. This project explores **predictive modeling** to identify customers at risk of leaving.

## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Load Libraries & Dataset
```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(caTools)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)

# Load dataset 
data <- read.csv("dataset/telecom_churn.csv")
head(data)

```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```{r}

# Summary statistics
summary(data)

# Churn distribution plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Churn, fill = Churn)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Customer Churn Distribution", x = "Churn", y = "Count")
```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Train-Test Split

```{r}

set.seed(1000)
split <- sample.split(data$Churn, SplitRatio = 0.7)
train <- subset(data, split == TRUE)
test <- subset(data, split == FALSE)

```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Logistic Regression Model

```{r}
# Build the logistic regression model
churn_model <- glm(Churn ~ MonthlyCharges + tenure + Contract, data = train, family = "binomial")

# Model summary
summary(churn_model)
```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Model Evaluation & ROC Curve

```{r}

# Predict probabilities
probabilities <- predict(churn_model, test, type = "response")

# Convert probabilities to binary outcome (threshold = 0.5)
predicted_churn <- ifelse(probabilities > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Plot ROC Curve
library(pROC)
roc_curve <- roc(test$Churn, probabilities)
plot(roc_curve, col = "blue", main = "ROC Curve for Churn Prediction")

```

## ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Conclusion

```{r}
The logistic regression model successfully identifies high-risk customers with an accuracy of r round(roc_curve$auc, 3).
With further optimization, this model can help reduce churn rates by enabling targeted customer retention strategies.
