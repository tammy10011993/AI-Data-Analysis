# 📊 House Price Prediction using Multiple Regression

## 🌟 Overview
This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression (OLS)** to predict **house prices** using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. We analyze various factors such as **crime rate, number of rooms, and tax rates** to understand their impact on house prices.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Summary statistics** of housing prices.
- **Correlation analysis** between different housing attributes.
- **Visualization of key relationships** using `ggplot2`.

## 📉 Regression Model
- **Training a Multiple Linear Regression model**.
- **Feature selection** to identify the most influential variables.
- **Evaluating model accuracy** using R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- The **number of rooms (rm)** and **lower status population (lstat)** were the most significant predictors.
- The model achieved an **R-squared value of 0.642**, explaining **64% of price variation**.
- Some variation in prices (20-30%) is still unexplained, indicating room for more complex models.
